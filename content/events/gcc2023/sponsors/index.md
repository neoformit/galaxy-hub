## Our thank you to the sponsors

Sponsors are potential partners in everyone's success, plus they make GCC
affordable and accessible We make a strong effort to seamlessly integrate
sponsors and their events into the broader GCC program, as well as promote
participant engagement. Furthermore, sponsor talks are generally scheduled
immediately preceding or following a keynote talk to maximize their attendance.
