# GCC2023 Abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of Galaxy Community
Conferences.  These include long talks, short talks, poster presentations, and
demo presentations.  All of these are submitted by the community and go through
a peer review process before being accepted for the program.

Abstract submission is open. **To submit an abstract, [fill out this
form](https://forms.gle/ETCPW8Vnprbij7zn6).** By submitting an abstract, you
agree that at least one of the authors will register and present the work
in-person at GCC2023.


## Abstract guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then
presentations) that will resonate with GCC2023 participants.

* **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract
  submission is a web form so no graphics or references are to be included.
* **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does your work use, describe, extend, deploy,
  benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem? If it does not, then it
  may not reviewed.
* **Compelling.** Is the work compelling? Will GCC2023 participants find your
  presentation interesting? Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting
  results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on.
* **Open Source / Open Access.** Not all presented work / resources must be open
  source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why
  it isn't. For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a
  firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and
  any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem. An abstract that
  merely highlights an inaccessible resource is not compelling.
* **Project Update.** If an abstract is a project update for a project that has
  previously been presented at a GCC, then it needs to describe a significant
  update to be considered for a talk. Minor updates submitted as talks will be
  offered a poster or demo spot.

## Option to publish in F1000 Galaxy gateway
Following GCC2023, you'll have an option to publish your slides or poster in the
[F1000 Galaxy gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy/). Besides
being a great collection of Galaxy-related content, each published artifact gets
a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), making it easier to reference in the future.
